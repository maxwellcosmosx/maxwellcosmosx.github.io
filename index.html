										<h3>The Little Prince</h3>
										<p><i>
										To Leon Werth.
										I ask children to forgive me for dedicating this book to a grown-up.
										I have a serious excuse: this grown-up is the best friend I have in the world.
										I have another excuse: this grown-up can understand everything, even books for children.
										I have a third excuse: he lives in France where he is hungry and cold. He needs to be comforted. 
										If all these excuses are not enough, then I want to dedicate this book to the child whom this grown-up once was. 
										All grown-ups were children first. But few of them remember it. So I correct my dedication:
										To Leon Werth.
										When he was a little boy.

										<h3>O Captain! My Captain!</h3>
										<p><i>
										O Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is done,
										The ship has weatherâ€™d every rack, the prize we sought is won,
										The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,
										While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring;
										But O heart! heart! heart!
										O the bleeding drops of red,
										Where on the deck my Captain lies,
										Fallen cold and dead.

									What do people gain from all their labors<br>
									at which they toil under the sun?<br>
									Generations come and generations go,<br>
									but the earth remains forever.<br>
									The sun rises and the sun sets,<br>
									and hurries back to where it rises.<br>
									The wind blows to the south<br>
									and turns to the north;<br>
									round and round it goes,<br>
									ever returning on its course.<br>
									All streams flow into the sea,<br>
									yet the sea is never full.<br>
									To the place the streams come from,<br>
									there they return again.<br>
									All things are wearisome,<br>
									more than one can say.<br>
									The eye never has enough of seeing,<br>
									nor the ear its fill of hearing.<br>
									What has been will be again,<br>
									what has been done will be done again;<br>
									there is nothing new under the sun.<br>
									Is there anything of which one can say,<br>
									"Look! This is something new"?<br>
									It was here already, long ago;<br>
									it was here before our time.<br>
									No one remembers the former generations,<br>
									and even those yet to come<br>
									will not be remembered<br>
									by those who follow them.<br>
